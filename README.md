# MSPartner ‚Äì Azure Lighthouse  

This repository contains the deployment templates required to enable **Azure Lighthouse** delegation for Silicom.  

Azure Lighthouse allows Silicom to manage your subscription securely, with the appropriate level of access, while you retain full control and visibility.  

---

## üîë What you need to know

- You must be an **Owner** or **User Access Administrator** on the subscription in order to onboard it to Azure Lighthouse.  
- The delegation is **non-intrusive**: it does not change your resources, only grants Silicom predefined access rights.  
- At any time, you can review or remove the delegation directly from the **Azure Portal** under **Service providers**.

## üöÄ Deploy to Azure

Choose the delegation level you want to grant. Clicking the button will open the Azure Portal with the pre-filled template.
